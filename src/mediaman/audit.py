"""Security event audit log.

Writes structured records to the existing ``audit_log`` table with a
dedicated ``sec:`` prefix on the ``action`` column so they're easy to
query separately from media actions. Records carry actor username,
client IP, and a short detail string. These events are the trail an
operator uses to reconstruct what a compromised session did.

Two write paths exist:

* :func:`security_event` — best-effort write that swallows exceptions.
  Suitable for events whose ABSENCE from the log is not by itself a
  security incident (login.success, session.destroy, etc.).
* :func:`security_event_or_raise` — fail-closed write that re-raises
  on failure and intentionally does NOT call ``conn.commit()`` so the
  caller can hold the write inside a wider ``BEGIN ... COMMIT``
  transaction. Privilege-establishing mutations (admin create / delete,
  password change, sensitive settings, lockout / unlock) MUST use this
  variant — if the audit row cannot be persisted the mutation must be
  rolled back so we never have a "the change happened but no one knows"
  situation.
